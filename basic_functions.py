    Write a function named right_justify that takes a string named s as a parameter and prints 
    the string with enough leading spaces so that the last letter of the string is in column 70
    of the display.

"""
    A function object is a value you can assign to a variable or pass as an argument. For example,
    do_twice is a function that takes a function object as an argument and calls it twice:

    def do_twice(f):
        f()
        f()

    Hereâ€™s an example that uses do_twice to call a function named print_spam twice.
    
    def print_spam():
        print('spam')

    do_twice(print_spam)

    1. Type this example into a script and test it.
    2. Modify do_twice so that it takes two arguments, a function object and a value, and calls
        the function twice, passing the value as an argument.
    3. Copy the definition of print_twice from earlier in this chapter to your script.
    4. Use the modified version of do_twice to call print_twice twice, passing 'spam' as an argument.
    5. Define a new function called do_four that takes a function object and a value and calls the
        function four times, passing the value as a parameter. There should be only two statements
        in the body of this function, not four.
